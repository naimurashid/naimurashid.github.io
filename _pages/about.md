Dr. Rashid is currently an associate professor (with tenure) in the Department of Biostatistics in the UNC Gillings School of Global Public Health.  As a faculty member with a joint appointment at the Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center (LCCC), he is devoted to research addressing basic science, translational, and clinical research problems in cancer.  His lab is involved in the development of novel statistical methodology supporting this aim, with a specific methodological focus in the areas of genomics, epigenomics, multi-study replicability, and machine learning.  

Outside of research, Dr. Rashid has designed and served as the statistician of record for a number of clinical trials in breast and pancreatic cancer, and have served as a statistical advisor for national cancer research organizations.  Through teaching and mentoring, he aspires to pass these passions on to his students and help prepare the next generation of statistical researchers.  In all, the Rashid Lab seeks to impact public health by pushing the boundaries of cancer research, and aiding in the development of new interventions and treatments for cancer.
