[Dr. Rashid](https://sph.unc.edu/adv_profile/naim-rashid-phd/) is  an associate professor (with tenure) in the [Department of Biostatistics](https://sph.unc.edu/bios/biostatistics/) at the [UNC Gillings School of Global Public Health](https://sph.unc.edu/), and has a joint appointment at the [Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center (LCCC)](https://unclineberger.org/).

The Rashid Lab is devoted to research addressing basic science, translational, and clinical research problems in cancer.  The lab is deeply involved in the development of novel statistical methodology supporting this aim, with a specific methodological focus in the areas of genomics, precision medicine, clinical trials, and machine learning.  

Through teaching and mentoring, Dr. Rashid aspires to pass these passions on to his students and help prepare the next generation of statistical researchers.   Ultimately, we hope to impact public health by pushing the boundaries of cancer research, and aiding in the development of new interventions and treatments for cancer.
