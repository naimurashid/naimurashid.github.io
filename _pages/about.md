I am an associate professor in the Department of Biostatistics at the Gillings School of Global Public Health at UNC-CH, with a joint appointment at the Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center. My methodological work spans several areas in genomics and statistics, addressing problems facing basic science, translational, and clinical researchers in cancer. Previously, I was a Postdoctoral Research Fellow with Giovanni Parmigiani in the Department of Data Sciences at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and the Department of Biostatistics at the Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health (joint with Nikhil Munshi). 

**Research Interests and Activities**
Precision medicine, high throughput epigenomics (ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq,etc.), multi-study learning, gene signature replicability, model-based clustering, alternative splicing (RNA-seq), proteomics, pancreatic cancer, and breast cancer. Additional detail can be found under Projects and Students.

Collaborative Work: As a member of the Lineberger Biostatistics Core I assist physicians and researchers with statistical problems relating to genomics and clinical studies. I am available for basic statistical consulting queries for all Lineberger Members.

Cancer Clinical Trials: I help oncologists design cancer clinical trials at UNC and elsewhere, serving as trial statistician on a number of active protocols. I am also a part of the Translational Breast Cancer Research Consortium Statistical Working Group, where I develop and review novel clinical trials in breast cancer with oncologists nationwide.

Teaching: I teach a course on Statistical Computing, BIOS 735, to PhD Students at Gillings, covering topics such R programming, various statistical and computational algorithms, and machine learning models.
