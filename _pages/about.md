**Overview**

Dr. Rashid is an [associate professor](https://sph.unc.edu/adv_profile/naim-rashid-phd/) (with tenure) in the [Department of Biostatistics](https://sph.unc.edu/bios/biostatistics/) at the [UNC Gillings School of Global Public Health](https://sph.unc.edu/), and has a joint appointment at the [Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center (LCCC)](https://unclineberger.org/). He currently serves as the Associate Director of the [Lineberger Biostatistics Shared Resource](https://unclineberger.org/biostats/), and co-directs the Biostatistics Cores of the UNC Pancreatic and Breast Cancer SPOREs. 

Dr. Rashid's lab is devoted to research addressing basic science, translational, and clinical problems in cancer.  His group is deeply involved in the development of novel statistical methodology supporting this aim, with a specific focus in the areas of genomics, precision medicine, clinical trials, and machine learning with applications to pancreatic and breast cancers.  

Ultimately, the Rashid lab hopes to impact public health by pushing the boundaries of cancer research through innovative new tools, and aid in the development of new interventions and treatments for cancer.  Through teaching and mentoring, Dr. Rashid hopes to pass on these passions to his students and help prepare the next generation of statistical researchers.
