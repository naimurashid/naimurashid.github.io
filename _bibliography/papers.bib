abstract = {Abstract Epigenomics, the study of the human genome and its interactions with proteins and other cellular elements, has become of significant interest in recent years. Such interactions have been shown to regulate essential cellular functions and are associated with multiple complex diseases. Therefore, understanding how these interactions may change across conditions is central in biomedical research. Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by massively parallel sequencing (ChIP-seq) is one of several techniques to detect local changes in epigenomic activity (peaks). However, existing methods for differential peak calling are not optimized for the diversity in ChIP-seq signal profiles, are limited to the analysis of two conditions, or cannot classify specific patterns of differential change when multiple patterns exist. To address these limitations, we present a flexible and efficient method for the detection of differential epigenomic activity across multiple conditions. We utilize data from the ENCODE Consortium and show that the presented method, epigraHMM, exhibits superior performance to current tools and it is among the fastest algorithms available, while allowing the classification of combinatorial patterns of differential epigenomic activity and the characterization of chromatin regulatory states.},

Immune signatures of macrophages, lymphocytes, TGFβ, IFNγ, wound healing, and cytotoxicity were measured. CIBERSORTx scores of naive and memory B cells, plasma cells, CD8+ T cells, resting and activated memory CD4+ T cells, M0 and M2 macrophages, and activated mast cells were measured.Increased M2 macrophage score [HR, 6.30; 95\\% confidence interval (CI), 3.0–12.15] and TGFβ signature expression (HR, 1.35; 95\\% CI, 1.05–1.77) were associated with shorter OS. Increased scores of plasma cells (HR, 0.55; 95\\% CI, 0.38–0.87) and activated memory CD4+ T cells (HR, 0.34; 95\\% CI, 0.16–0.65) were associated with longer OS. Using optimal cutoffs from these four features, patients were categorized as having either 4, 3, 2, or 0–1 beneficial features associated with longer OS, and the median (95\\% CI) OS decreased from 42.5 (35.8–47.8) to 31.0 (28.8–34.4), 25.2 (20.6–27.9), and 17.7 (13.5–20.4) months respectively (P = 3.48e–11).New immune features can be further evaluated to improve patient response. They provide the rationale for more effective immunotherapy strategies.}",
