Amber is currently a PhD student at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, working under the guidance of Drs. Naim Rashid and [Didong Li](https://sites.google.com/view/didongli/). Amber graduated from Purdue University in 2019 with a Bachelor's of Science in Mathematics and Statistics. After joining UNC Chapel Hill, she was a trainee on the National Cancer Institute's (NCI) Cancer Genomics Training Grant program for three years. Her current dissertation work focuses on molecular subtype discovery in pancreatic cancer, where she aims to create methods for identifying clinically relevant and replicable cancer subtypes via semi-supervised matrix factorization methods.
