My contribution to the fields of biostatistics and cancer research has been substantial, as evidenced by over 50 papers that I have co-authored in high impact peer reviewed journals related to cancer, genomics, medicine, and statistics. Such research results have directly contributed to various domains in cancer, including immunotherapy, epigenomics, precision medicine, and drug discovery using rigorous and innovative statistical methods. In addition, statistical methods that I have developed have similarly had wide impact in pancreatic cancer.  For example, my research on developing robust molecular subtyping tools has resulted in the first clinically applicable test for prospective treatment selection in pancreatic cancer (PurIST).  This work has been awarded a provisional patent, passed CLIA certification for clinical trial use, has appeared in journals such as Nature Genetics and Clinical Cancer Research, and is currently under evaluation in multiple clinical trials as a diagnostic tool.  My methods and collaborative work on identifying patterns of protein-DNA interactions in high throughput cancer sequencing data have also had wide impact,  leading to publications in Nature, PNAS, Genome Biology, and other top journals. Several of my methods publications concerning cancer precision medicine and genomics have appeared in top journals in statistics, such as Journal of the American Statistical Association and Biometrics. Many of these statistical methods have been implemented as open-source software packages for the public to use.  

In pancreatic cancer, I am currently co-PI of U01 CA274298 with Drs. Jen Jen Yeh and Susan Tsai where we are developing machine learning tools to subtype patient stroma in pancreatic cancer and examine its interaction with tumor subtypes on clinical outcomes. I am also co-leader of the UNC SPORE in Pancreatic Cancerâ€™s Integrated Quantitative Sciences Core, where I assist in the design and analysis of SPORE project data and develop new statistical tools in support of SPORE aims.  Lastly, I am the lead statistician and designer of the PROCLAIM study with Dr. Jen Jen Yeh that is examining the use of mobile health tools in reducing racial disparities in pancreatic cancer clinical trial awareness and recruitment. 

I have also had long-standing collaborations in breast cancer, spanning basic, translational, and clinical research. I co-direct the biostatistics and bioinformatics core of the UNC Breast SPORE, and I am a member of the Statistical Working Group of the Translational Breast Cancer Research Consortium where I assist in protocol review and development.  I am also the statistician of record for a number of ongoing breast cancer clinical trials, such as the HARMONY trial (NCT03769415, PI Lisa Carey) and the InCITe trial (NCT03971409), a large multicenter trial coordinated out of UCSF evaluating three novel immunotherapy agents for patients with recurrent stage IV or unresectable triple negative breast cancer.  Lastly, I am a member of the Scientific Advisory Committee of the V Foundation for Cancer Research, where I interact and work with breast cancer oncologists and other researchers from across the country. 

## Short Bio

Dr. Naim Rashid is an associate professor in the Department of Biostatistics with a joint appointment at the Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center. His methodological work spans several areas in genomics and statistics, addressing problems facing basic science, translational, and clinical researchers in cancer. Recent areas of research include precision medicine, multi-study replicability, epigenomics, cancer subtyping, and missing data problems in deep learning. 

Dr. Rashid also engages in collaborative studies at Lineberger, working with physicians and researchers on problems relating to genomics and clinical studies. He also aids in the design of cancer clinical trials at UNC and elsewhere, serving as trial statistician on a number of active protocols. As a member of the Translational Breast Cancer Research Consortium Statistical Working Group, he develops and reviews novel clinical trials in breast cancer with oncologists nationwide.  

Each spring, Dr. Rashid also teaches BIOS 735, a doctoral-level course covering topics such as writing efficient and reproducible code, implementing various optimization and numerical integration algorithms, and applying multiple machine learning methods.

Previously, Dr. Rashid was a postdoctoral fellow at the Depart Harvard School of Public Health and the Dana Farber Cancer Institute under Giovanni Parmigiani and Nohil Munshi.
